This project aims to enhance online shopping by providing interactive 3D product visualizations directly within a web browser. 
The project will develop a web application using Angular that allows users to explore products in 3D, rotate them, zoom in on details, and view them from different angles. 
This innovative approach will improve product perception, enhance customer engagement, and provide a more informative online shopping experience. 
Data, including 3D models and product information, can be stored and managed using Azure cloud services.
