This is the problem staement of the project :
This project aims to enhance online shopping by providing interactive 3D product visualizations directly within a web browser. 
The project will develop a web application using Angular that allows users to explore products in 3D, rotate them, zoom in on details, and view them from different angles. 
This innovative approach will improve product perception, enhance customer engagement, and provide a more informative online shopping experience. 
Data, including 3D models and product information, can be stored and managed using Azure cloud services.

The following user stories send to the project mentor :

And the project mentor replied back for this user stories as follows :
Went through the user stories,
1.Some stories are quite broad. For example: 
•	"As a Customer, I want to view different categories of the products so that I don't need to go to other application for other product category." Could be broken down into more specific actions like browsing by category, sub-category, or using a navigation menu.
•	"As a Customer, I want to be able to see the price range so that I can find the products easily which are in my budget." Could include details like filtering by price range or seeing the price clearly displayed.
2.Some stories might have implicit assumptions that need to be made explicit. For example, how will the 3D models be loaded? What are the performance expectations?
3.Ensure all "Must Have" stories are absolutely essential for the initial viable product with 3D viewing.
4. For each user story, define clear and measurable acceptance criteria. This will help the development team understand when a story is complete and working correctly. For example, for story #7 ("As a Customer, I want to rotate products in 3D so that I can see them from different angles."), acceptance criteria could include: 
•	The product model can be rotated smoothly in all directions (horizontal and vertical).
•	Rotation is responsive to mouse or touch input.
•	No significant lag or performance issues during rotation.
Add one more column in excel sheet as Acceptance crietria.


Do the changes and be clear who is going to do which user stories. we can meet by 12pm.
